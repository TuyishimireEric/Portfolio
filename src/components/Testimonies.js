              Tuyishimire Eric is a proactive, result-oriented,
              responsible, and technically sound developer and always ready to put all his

            <h3>Pierre Celestin Moussa</h3>
            <p>
              Eric and I worked together on several projects and we study
              together at Microverse,
              and I was lucky to call him my coworker.
              He consistently gave 100 percent effort to the team and played a
              significant role in ensuring that we completed assignments on time.
              He had excellent time management skills and had a knack
              for keeping everyone calm and productive
              during intense crunch periods. Eric is proactive too and
              any team would be lucky to have him as
              a coworker, and I couldnâ€™t recommend him more for any
              business looking for new talent.
